    <h1>Aleksandr Bugaevskii</h1>
    <p>My name is Alexander Bugaevsky. This is my first semester at Fox Valley Tech College. I programmed in Python in Visual Studio Code. I also tried to learn HTML and SQL two years ago, but gave up because I didn't understand anything. This time the material is clearer to me. I tried many hobbies, but my favorite is singing.My goal is to find my area of programming. I don't know yet what I like the most, but I hope to find out.</p>
